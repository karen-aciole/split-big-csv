#  Split BIG CSV file into smaller files using pandas :pinching_hand: 

### The files will be moved to a new folder in order to keep organized. 

### **Steps**: 

1. You need to edit the parameters in 'main' function.

:warning: _in case the file isn't in the current directory of the script, and you copy the path like this: 
<code>'C:\Users\name\path\to\file.csv'</code> make sure to add <code>r</code> in the parameter before run. It should be look like this: <code>r'C:\Users\name\path\to\file.csv'</code>_ 

2. Save and run <code> python split_csv.py</code> in terminal. 
3. It will show the path where the files were save :)
